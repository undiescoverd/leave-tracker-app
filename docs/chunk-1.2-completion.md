# Chunk 1.2 Completion Summary: Database Seeding & Testing

## 🎯 Overview
Chunk 1.2 has been successfully completed, providing comprehensive database seeding and authentication testing for the TDH Agency Leave Tracker.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Seeding Script (`prisma/seed.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Creates test users for development and testing
- **Users Created**:
  - **Senay Taormina** (Admin) - senay.taormina@tdhagency.com
  - **Ian Vincent** (Admin) - ian.vincent@tdhagency.com
  - **Sup Dhanasunthorn** (User) - sup.dhanasunthorn@tdhagency.com
  - **Luis Drake** (User) - luis.drake@tdhagency.com
- **Default Password**: `Password123!` (for all users)
- **Features**:
  - Uses `upsert` to avoid duplicate users
  - Properly hashes passwords with bcrypt
  - Provides clear console output
  - Handles errors gracefully

### 2. Authentication Testing Script (`scripts/test-auth.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of authentication and authorization
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Database connection verification
  - User existence and role assignment
  - Password authentication for all users
  - API endpoint functionality
  - Route protection (dashboard redirect)
- **Features**:
  - Detailed test results with pass/fail status
  - Summary statistics
  - Clear error reporting
  - Exit codes for CI/CD integration

### 3. Package.json Scripts
- `npm run db:seed` - Run database seeding
- `npm run test:auth` - Run authentication tests
- `npm run test:setup` - Run both seeding and testing

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with testing instructions
- Updated development-progress.md with completion status
- Added comprehensive usage examples

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Seed the database with test users
npm run db:seed

# Run authentication tests
npm run test:auth

# Or run both in sequence
npm run test:setup
```

### Manual Testing
After seeding, you can manually test the application:

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login with any test user**:
   - Email: `senay.taormina@tdhagency.com` (Admin)
   - Password: `Password123!`

3. **Test different roles**:
   - **Admins** (Senay, Ian): Can access admin routes
   - **Users** (Sup, Luis): Can access user routes only

## 📊 Test Results Example
When you run `npm run test:auth`, you'll see output like:
```
🧪 Starting Authentication Tests...
📍 Base URL: http://localhost:3000
🔑 Test Password: Password123!

✅ Database Connection: Connected successfully. Found 4 users.

🔐 Testing User Authentication...
✅ User Exists - Senay Taormina: Found user with role: ADMIN
✅ Password Auth - Senay Taormina: Password authentication successful
✅ Role Assignment - Senay Taormina: Role correctly assigned: ADMIN
...
