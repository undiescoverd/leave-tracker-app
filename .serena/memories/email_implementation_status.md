# Email Implementation Status

## Current Email Infrastructure

### Existing Implementation
- **Location:** `src/lib/email/service.ts`
- **Status:** Development-only (console logging)
- **Functions:**
  - `sendPasswordResetEmail()` - For forgot password flow
  - `sendLeaveNotificationEmail()` - Generic notification function

### Current Behavior
- **Development:** Logs email content to console with formatted output
- **Production:** Returns error "Email service not configured for production"

## Integration Points
- **Password Reset:** Already integrated in forgot-password API
- **Leave Notifications:** Function exists but not integrated in leave approval/rejection flow

## Ready for Enhancement
The project has email infrastructure in place and is ready for:
1. Real email service provider integration (Resend recommended)
2. Integration with leave request lifecycle
3. Template enhancement with React Email
4. Queue implementation for production reliability

## Environment Variables Needed
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - For Resend integration
- `EMAIL_FROM` - Sender email address
- `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` - Reply-to address
- `ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` - Feature flag
